Internal build and deployment scripts.

Set a variable APROJECTS that points to the base directory containing
atools, littlenavconnect and littlenavmap if you want to use these.

Builds will go into "build-PROJECT-release" or "build-PROJECT-debug" folders in the folder defined in APROJECTS.
Results will be placed in "%APROJECTS%/deploy".
