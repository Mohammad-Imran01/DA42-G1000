Note

This is the Little Navmap 64-bit build. It can be used for MSFS and X-Plane.

Note that Little Navmap and all related programs are interoperable across the network (Little Navmap and Little Navconnect) as well as the X-Plane plugin (Little Navmap, Little Navconnect and Little Xpconnect).

Also both 64-bit and 32-bit builds share the same settings and databases. You can install both builds and switch from one to another without problems.

See the user manual about the installation of Little Xpconnect if you use X-Plane.
