# DA42 G1000 PFD-MFD Displays Project

Welcome to the **DA42 G1000 PFD-MFD Displays** project! I'm currently an intern at **AerX Labs**, working on this exciting project.

## Overview

The project, developed using **Qt 5.15**, incorporates a **C# GenVar** application to fetch real-time flight simulator data from **Prepar3D**. This data is seamlessly integrated into the **G1000 PFD-MFD displays** using interprocess communication, creating a realistic flight simulation experience.

### Navigation System

The navigation system uses **Atool**, **Marble**, and [**Littlenavmap**](https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap) to enhance navigation capabilities. The project is a work in progress, and I'm thrilled to share updates with the community.

## Acknowledgments

Special shoutout to my office colleagues for their fantastic support during development.
A big thank you to **Albar** for the open-source [**Littlenavmap**](https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap) application, crucial for improving navigation features.
